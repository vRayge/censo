Censorship In Your Favour. Censo — A minimalist movie sensitivity filter app that provides real-time, human-style scene warnings for sensitive content like gore, profanity, nudity, and trauma.

**Censo** is a minimalist movie sensitivity filter app that provides real-time, human-style scene warnings for sensitive content such as gore, profanity, nudity, and trauma.
